WARNING
Opera Air is in beta so I wouldn't use it as my main browser YET.
Opera Air has been made very recently and there is going to likely be bugs.
And if you want raw performence Opera Air is not for you.
Because Opera Air is made for a nice expierence for the mind, not performence like opera gx.
So keep in mind, Opera Air is purely for the mind.
Also, Opera Air is made by Opera Norway, I just deliver bug patches and sometimes new features faster then them.
And I am still learning github so thats why there isnt many files yet. If you want to see all files if I were you I would just install Opera Air, then open file location to view all files.
Wish you the best luck on finding the browser for you! even if it is not Opera Air.
